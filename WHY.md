# Why Use PomChat?

## 🌟 A Different Kind of Messaging Platform

In a world full of messaging apps like Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Telegram, and Signal, why should you use PomChat to communicate with me? Here's why:

### 1. 📚 Open Source & Transparent
- **Your Data is Yours**: All messages are stored in both a local SQLite database and GitHub repositories, giving you complete access to your data.
- **No Black Boxes**: The entire codebase is open source and available on GitHub. You can verify how the app works and even contribute improvements.

### 2. 💾 Message Storage
- **Dual Storage**: Messages are stored both locally in SQLite and in GitHub repositories.
- **Simple Access**: Just enter your name (or stay anonymous) and start messaging.
- **Web Interface**: Access messages through a clean, modern web interface.

### 3. 🔍 Message Organization
- **Chronological Order**: Messages are displayed in reverse chronological order.
- **Permanent Timestamps**: Every message includes an ISO format timestamp.
- **Repository Tracking**: See which repository each message comes from.

### 4. 🛠 Developer-Friendly
- **JSON Format**: Messages are stored in a clean JSON format.
- **API Access**: Access messages through simple HTTP endpoints.
- **Local Development**: Easy to set up and run locally.

### 5. 🎯 Simple & Focused
- **Clean Interface**: A modern, responsive web interface.
- **No Distractions**: Just messages, authors, and timestamps.
- **Auto-Refresh**: Messages update automatically every 30 seconds.

### 6. 🔐 Current Privacy Considerations
- **Public Repository**: Messages are currently stored in public GitHub repositories without encryption. Only use this for non-sensitive communications.
- **No Data Mining**: Your messages won't be analyzed for advertising or "engagement optimization".
- **No Tracking**: No analytics, no user profiling, no behavior tracking.
- **Future Plans**: End-to-end encryption is planned for future versions to enable private communications.

### 7. 💡 Technical Features
- **Multiple Repositories**: Support for fetching messages from multiple GitHub repositories.
- **Command Line Interface**: Manage environment variables and configurations via CLI.
